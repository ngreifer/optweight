*optweight* contains functions to estimate stable balancing weights that
balance covariates up to given thresholds. It solves a convex
optimization problem to minimize a function of the weights that captures
their variability (or divergence from a set of base weights). This is
the method described in Zubizarreta
([2015](#ref-zubizarretaStableWeightsThat2015)), Källberg and Waernbaum
([2023](#ref-kallbergLargeSampleProperties2023)), and Wang and
Zubizarreta ([2020](#ref-wangMinimalDispersionApproximately2020)).
*optweight* extends the method to multi-category, continuous, and
multivariate treatments and provides a simple user interface and
compatibility with the [*cobalt*](https://ngreifer.github.io/cobalt/)
package for balance assessment. See
[`vignette("optweight")`](https://ngreifer.github.io/optweight/articles/optweight.md)
for a more thorough description of the package’s capabilities.

To install *optweight*, use the code below:

``` r
#CRAN version
install.packages("optweight")

#Development version
pak::pkg_install("ngreifer/optweight")
```

Below is an example of estimating weights with *optweight* and assessing
balance on the covariates with *cobalt*.

``` r
library("optweight")
library("cobalt")

data("lalonde")

# Estimate weights
ow <- optweight(treat ~ age + educ + race + nodegree + married +
                  re74 + re75,
                data = lalonde,
                estimand = "ATT",
                tols = .01,
                min.w = 0)
ow
```

``` R
#> An optweight object
#>  - number of obs.: 614

``` r

```

We can see that all standardized mean differences are at or below .01 in
absolute value, as requested using the `tols` argument. Because we set
`min.w = 0`, some units received weights of 0, effectively dropping them
from the sample (by default, the smallest weight allowed is
\\10^{-8}\\).

We can use [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) to
examine the dual variables for each constraint, which represent how
active that constraint is at the optimal point. Highly active
constraints affect the objective function value the most when their
tolerances are changed.

``` r
plot(ow)
```

![](reference/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

We can see that `race` has the highest dual variable; relaxing the
constraint on `race` would yield the biggest improvement in effective
sample size, while tightening its constraint would yield the biggest
decrease in effective sample size.

The lower-level function
[`optweight.fit()`](https://ngreifer.github.io/optweight/reference/optweight.md)
operates on the covariates and treatment variables directly.
[`optweightMV()`](https://ngreifer.github.io/optweight/reference/optweightMV.md)
supports multivariate (i.e., multiple) treatments.

In addition to estimating balancing weights for estimating treatment
effects, *optweight* can estimate sampling weights for generalizing an
estimate to a new target population defined by covariate moments using
[`optweight.svy()`](https://ngreifer.github.io/optweight/reference/optweight.svy.md),
which implements the methods described in Jackson, Rhodes, and Ouwens
([2021](#ref-jacksonAlternativeWeightingSchemes2021)) for
matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC).
