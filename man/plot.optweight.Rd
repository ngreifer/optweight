\title{
Plot Dual Variables for Assessing Balance Constraints
}
\description{
Plots the dual variables resulting from \code{optweight} in a way similar to figure 2 of Zubizarreta (2015), which explained how to interpret these values. These represent the cost of changing the constraint on the variance of the resulting weights. For covariates with large values of the dual variable, tightening the constraint will increase the variability of the weights, and loosening the constraint will decrease the variability of the weights, both to a greater extent than would doing the same for covariate with small values of the dual variable.

             # on age had a negligible effect on the

summary(ow3) # In contrast, tightening the constraint
             # on married had a large effect on the
