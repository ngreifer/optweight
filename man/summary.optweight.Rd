\title{Summarize, print, and plot information about estimated weights}
\usage{
\method{summary}{optweight}(object, top = 5, ignore.s.weights = FALSE, ...)

\method{summary}{optweightMSM}(object, top = 5, ignore.s.weights = FALSE, ...)

\method{summary}{optweight.svy}(object, top = 5, ignore.s.weights = FALSE, ...)

\method{plot}{summary.optweight}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{optweight}, \code{optweightMSM}, or \code{optweight.svy} object; the output of a call to \code{\link[=optweight]{optweight()}} or \code{\link[=optweight.svy]{optweight.svy()}}.}

\item{top}{How many of the largest and smallest weights to display. Default
is 5.}

\item{ignore.s.weights}{Whether or not to ignore sampling weights when
computing the weight summary. If \code{FALSE}, the default, the estimated
weights will be multiplied by the sampling weights (if any) before values
are computed.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments. For \code{plot()}, additional arguments
passed to \code{\link[graphics:hist]{graphics::hist()}} to determine the number of bins,
though \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_histogram]{ggplot2::geom_histogram()}} from \pkg{ggplot2} is actually
used to create the plot.}

\item{x}{A \code{summary.optweight}, \code{summary.optweightMSM}, or \code{summary.optweight.svy} object; the output of a call to \code{summary.optweight()}, \code{summary.optweightMSM()}, or ()\code{summary.optweight.svy}.}
}
\value{
For point treatments (i.e., \code{optweight} objects),
\code{summary()} returns a \code{summary.optweight} object with the following
elements:
\item{weight.range}{The range (minimum and maximum) weight for
each treatment group.}
\item{weight.top}{The units with the greatest weights
in each treatment group; how many are included is determined by \code{top}.}
\item{rms.dev}{The root-mean-squared deviation of the estimated weights from the base weights (L2 norm).}
\item{mean.abs.dev}{The mean absolute deviation of the estimated weights from the base weights (L1 norm).}
\item{max.abs.dev}{The maximum absolute deviation of the estimated weights from the base weights (L\eqn{\infinity} norm).}
\item{num.zeros}{The number of units with a weight equal to 0.}
\item{effective.sample.size}{The effective sample size for each treatment group before and after weighting.}

For longitudinal treatments (i.e., \code{optweightMSM} objects), a list of
the above elements for each treatment period.

For \code{optweight.svy} objects, a list of the above elements but with no
treatment group divisions.

\code{plot()} returns a \code{ggplot} object with a histogram displaying the
distribution of the estimated weights. If the estimand is the ATT or ATC,
only the weights for the non-focal group(s) will be displayed (since the
weights for the focal group are all 1). A dotted line is displayed at the
mean of the weights (usually 1).
}
\description{
These functions summarize the weights resulting from a call to
\code{\link[=optweight]{optweight()}} or \code{\link[=optweight.svy]{optweight.svy()}}. \code{summary()} produces summary statistics on the distribution of weights, including their
range and variability, and the effective sample size of the weighted sample
(computing using the formula in McCaffrey, Rudgeway, & Morral, 2004). \code{plot()} creates a histogram of the weights.
