# optweight: Optimization-Based Stable Balancing Weights

Use optimization to estimate weights that balance covariates for binary,
multi-category, continuous, and multivariate treatments in the spirit of
Zubizarreta (2015)
[doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1023805](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2015.1023805)
. The degree of balance can be specified for each covariate. In
addition, sampling weights can be estimated that allow a sample to
generalize to a population specified with given target moments of
covariates, as in matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC).
