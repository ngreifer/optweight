#' Estimate Targeting Weights Using Optimization
#'
#' Estimate targeting weights for covariates specified in `formula`. The
#' target means are specified with `targets` and the maximum distance
#' between each weighted covariate mean and the corresponding target mean is
#' specified by `tols`. See Zubizarreta (2015) for details of the
#' properties of the weights and the methods used to fit them.
#'
#' @inheritParams optweight.svy.fit
#' @inheritDotParams optweight.svy.fit norm min.w std.binary std.cont
#' @param formula A formula with nothing on the left hand side and the
#' covariates to be targeted on the right hand side. See [glm()] for
#' more details. Interactions and functions of covariates are allowed.
#' @param data An optional data set in the form of a data frame that contains
#' the variables in `formula`.
#' @param tols A vector of target balance tolerance values for each covariate.
#' The resulting weighted covariate means will be no further away from the
#' targets than the specified values. If only one value is supplied, it will be
#' applied to all covariates. Can also be the output of a call to [check_tols()].
#' @param s.weights A vector of sampling weights or the name of a variable in `data` that contains sampling weights. Optimization occurs on the product of the sampling weights and the estimated weights.
#' @param b.weights A vector of base weights or the name of a variable in `data` that contains base weights. If supplied, the desired norm of the distance between the estimated weights and the base weights is minimized.
#' @param verbose Whether information on the optimization problem solution
#' should be printed. This information contains how many iterations it took to
#' estimate the weights and whether the solution is optimal.
#'
#' @details
#' The optimization is performed by the lower-level function
#' [optweight.svy.fit()] using [osqp::solve_osqp()] in the
#' \pkg{osqp} package, which provides a straightforward interface to specifying
#' the constraints and objective function for quadratic optimization problems
#' and uses a fast and flexible solving algorithm.
#'
#' Weights are estimated so that the standardized differences between the
#' weighted covariate means and the corresponding targets are within the given
#' tolerance thresholds (unless `std.binary` or `std.cont` are
#' `FALSE`, in which case unstandardized mean differences are considered
#' for binary and continuous variables, respectively). For a covariate \eqn{x}
#' with specified tolerance \eqn{\delta}, the weighted mean will be within
#' \eqn{\delta} of the target. If standardized tolerance values are requested,
#' the standardization factor is the standard deviation of the covariate in the
#' whole sample. The standardization factor is always unweighted.
#'
#' See the [optweight()] help page for information on interpreting
#' dual variables and solving convergence failure.

#' An `optweight.svy` object with the following elements:
#' \item{weights}{The estimated weights, one for each unit.}
#' \item{covs}{The
#' covariates used in the fitting. Only includes the raw covariates, which may
#' have been altered in the fitting process.}
#' \item{s.weights}{The provided
#' sampling weights.}
#' \item{call}{The function call.}
#' \item{tols}{The tolerance
#' values for each covariate.}
#' \item{duals}{A data.frame containing the dual
#' variables for each covariate. See Details for interpretation of these
#' values.}
#' \item{info}{The `info` component of the output of
#' [osqp::solve_osqp()], which contains information on the
#' performance of the optimization at termination.}
